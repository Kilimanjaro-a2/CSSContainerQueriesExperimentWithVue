https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5796

## Demo
Here is a demo page that actually works.

It uses polyfill, so it will work in unsupported browsers.

You can drag and drop cards to the dotted area to move them there.

The moved card will automatically change its style by comparing the width of the area with the Container Queriers condition described in the card component.

You can see the details of the card components in [src/Card.vue](https://github.com/Kilimanjaro-a2/CSSContainerQueriesExperimentWithVue/blob/main/src/Card.vue).
